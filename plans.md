# WEEK 1 - PLANNING

## hemisphere description

The project will be a social media site based around transfer of skills, and discussion around them. It will have direct messaging and subreddit style groups where people can post their problems and get helped by many others. It will allow for experts to help intermediates and beginners in their choice of interest and allow for people all around the world to develop their skills and meet likeminded individuals. For example; a junior carpenter may make a post about how best to cut a certain type of wood, and get helpful answers and tips in the comments from proffesionals/experts, as well as meeting other people with the same interest to talk to.

| Design choice | Reasoning |
|---|---|
| Colour Palette | Colour palette follows brand colours (blues-purples), while making sure theyre muted enough and with enough lighter shades such as greys so as to not be harsh on the eyes
| Fonts | Body text uses sans serif fonts to be easy on the eyes, fonts also contrast in colour from their backgrounds for readability. Users will have the option to decide the font on their profile for customisation - however from a specific list of fonts so users cant use deliberately illegible fonts
| Images/Icons | Most images will be picked by the user themself - such as profile pictures, community icons, and images submitted to communities. Other icons such as in the messenger are based on standard industry designs so people know how to use them


# WEEK 2 - SECOND DESIGN
