# WEEK 1 - PLANNING

## hemisphere description

The project will be a social media site based around transfer of skills, and discussion around them. It will have direct messaging and subreddit style groups where people can post their problems and get helped by many others. It will allow for experts to help intermediates and beginners in their choice of interest and allow for people all around the world to develop their skills and meet likeminded individuals. For example; a junior carpenter may make a post about how best to cut a certain type of wood, and get helpful answers and tips in the comments from proffesionals/experts, as well as meeting other people with the same interest to talk to.


functional requirements:

- [ ] 'subreddit' style groups
- [ ] account registration
- [ ] direct messenger
- [ ] ability to post and comment

non-functional requirements:

- [ ] personalised profile (pfp, about me etc..)
- [ ] well organised pages
- [ ] fast and efficient running


# WEEK 2 - WIREFRAMING AND DESIGN


- removed one page(old landing page) from last years website idea, and added a new one (messenger)



| Design choice | Reasoning |
|---|---|
| Colour Palette | Colour palette follows brand colours (blues-purples), while making sure theyre muted enough and with enough lighter shades such as greys so as to not be harsh on the eyes
| Fonts | Body text uses sans serif fonts to be easy on the eyes, fonts also contrast in colour from their backgrounds for readability. Users will have the option to decide the font on their profile for customisation - however from a specific list of fonts so users cant use deliberately illegible fonts
| Images/Icons | Most images will be picked by the user themself - such as profile pictures, community icons, and images submitted to communities. Other icons such as in the messenger are based on standard industry designs so people know how to use them


# WEEK 3 - SECOND DESIGN

- Much more 'natural' colours; browns and greys
- More focus on 'working'; workbench background
- Showed alternative custom profile
- Got rid of messenger, instead replacing it with a log page as a messenger most likely would not work


# WEEK 4 - Algorithm design

- Multiple algorithms designed for plans for sign in and sign up pages
- Successful and unsuccessful trials planned for
- Successful use of 

# WEEKS 5-6 - Databases

- Successful creation of a database through the posted tutorial
- Simple manipulation of databases through SQL
- Not enough understanding of databases (post note, came back to bite me)

# WEEKS 7-8 - Creating and styling of website

- First webpage set up through tutorial, in template setup
- Basic CSS styling
- Second and third webpages set up
- Somewhat more CSS styling

# WEEKS 9-10 - Adding interactivity

- Linkages between webpages
- Continued CSS styling with input boxes for login/signup
- Half-interactions with posts
- Still no real database use
- Tested using google lighthouse, went very well, 98% total


# Holidays - Away, unable to work



# Post Project - Brief reflection

I feel I haven't completed it nearly up to standard and I am somewhat dissapointed in myself, I simply didn't know what I was doing and didn't know how to learn what to do the entire time, the task seemed so insurmountable I barely knew how to work on it and what to work on. I should've asked for more help with the project, maybe with you and maybe with friends. Despite everything I have however still learned more about web design working with large files and I am happy about that.
